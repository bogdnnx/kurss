The dataset includes 218 images.
Cars are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:

The following augmentation was applied to create 2 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Randomly crop between 0 and 55 percent of the image
* Random rotation of between -45 and +45 degrees
* Random shear of between -25째 to +25째 horizontally and -25째 to +25째 vertically
